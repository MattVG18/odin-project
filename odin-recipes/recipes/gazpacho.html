    <p>Gazpacho soup is a perfect soup for summer</p>
    <p>Just remember to keep it refrigerated</p>
    <p><strong><em>Disclaimer</em></strong></p>
    <p>If you expect something to be cold, but instead it is room temp, it feels like it is scalding hot</p1>
    <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 medium tomato, cored and cut into quarters</li>
        <li>1 small cucumber, peeled and cut into large chunks</li>
        <li>Flesh from 1/2 avocado, cut into large chunks</li>
        <li>3 large basil leaves</li>
        <li>1/2 jalapeño (optional)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup lightly packed watercress or baby spinach leaves</li>
        <li>1 small celery stalk (optional)</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon red wine vinegar, or more to taste</li>

        </li>
        <li><p>Stem and seed the jalapeño half and reserve the seeds. Cut the jalapeño into several pieces. Combine one or</p>

            <p>addition. Refrigerate until cold, then pour into a bowl and top with the reserved chopped tomato, cucumber,</p>
            <p>avocado, and basil and a drizzle of olive oil, and eat.</p>
